# BeatVid – Create stunning videos from images
BeatVid is a macOS app for music producers and podcasters who want to post their beat videos, podcasts and other audio content on social media. In just a couple of clicks, BeatVid creates a HD 1920×1080 video file which can be posted to YouTube and other social media platforms. Creating compelling content couldn’t be easier!

## Why is this app open-source?
BeatVid started off as a paid-for app on the Mac App Store. First released in 2022, I built BeatVid to solve one particular problem: generating videos for my hiphop beats youtube channel, [BigSmilezBeats](https://www.youtube.com/@BigSmilezBeats). 

After a brief run on the App Store, the demand for this app declined and I assume that this was in part due to the availability more capable, feature rich & almost-free video editing applications such as Capcut, Filmora etc. 

Fast forward to today, 22nd Jul 2024.  I was going through a brilliant [blog post](https://supabase.com/blog/should-i-open-source-my-company) by the folks over at Supabase which had me thinking that somebody might benefit from the source code or the app in itself. So here it is, the source code for BeatVid, open-sourced, MIT.

## How to build BeatVid
1. Open `BeatVid.xcodeproject` in the latest version of Xcode. (I have tested with Xcode 15.1)
2. Build the project and enjoy! There are zero external dependencies.
